Create a speaking HW assignment that uses ASR and dumps answers into a Google Sheet. Particularly good for foreign language / EFL teachers.

For teachers who want to be able to change the langauge, please contact me or change the appropriate places in the code. For the easiest mode, please see the YouTube video that explains how to set this up as easy as possible.
